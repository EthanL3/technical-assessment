I had a lot of fun with this project and learned a lot about using an Express server to handle the user inputted emails. The hardest part was figuring out a lot of the syntax for React, as am I still somewhat of
a beginner to the framework. Also, it was my first time using a UI library (mui), and using one made
it much easier for clean and consistent styling.
